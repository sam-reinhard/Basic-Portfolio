            <p>Hi, I'm Sam! I don't really know what to say, so right now this is
                going to just be some placeholder text. I'll get around to the rest
                of this this weekend or on the other two days that I have off
                until I have to submit this website. Man, I hope I can figure it out.
                Nothing seems too complicated but there's definitely a lot that I'm 
                going to have to brush up on to get this shit done. I mean really.
            </p>

            <p>Okay, here's some more rambling to act as a placeholder. I'm really just
                trying to get a feel for how this is going to look, so bear with me.
            </p>
            
            <p>One final little blurb for good measure. Hopefully this allows me to start
                styling everything while I figure out what to write.
